### AIM  
To write a Python program to demonstrate polymorphism by creating two classes India and USA with the same method names (capital(), language(), and type()) and then accessing them using a common interface.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.
2. Define the class `India` with methods `capital()`, `language()`, and `type()`.
3. Define the class `USA` with the same methods `capital()`, `language()`, and `type()`.
4. Create objects `obj_ind` for the `India` class and `obj_usa` for the `USA` class.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the objects and call the common methods.
6. Display the output for both countries.
7. End the program.

### PROGRAM
```
Reg.No: 212223060145
Name: Madhumitha V

class India():
    
	def capital(self):
		print("New Delhi is the capital of India.")

	def language(self):
		print("Hindi is the most widely spoken language of India.")

	def type(self):
		print("India is a developing country.")

class USA():
    
	def capital(self):
		print("Washington, D.C. is the capital of USA.")

	def language(self):
		print("English is the primary language of USA.")
	def type(self):
		print("USA is a developed country.")

obj_ind = India()
obj_usa = USA()

for country in (obj_ind, obj_usa):
    country.capital()
    country.language()
    country.type()
```

### RESULT
Thus, the program to demonstrate polymorphism using two classes was executed successfully and the output was verified.
